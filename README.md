# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for AoC 2022 in Go (golang).

For most solutions, I also provide a unit test which is based on the example text of the challenge. Feel free to use the tests for your own challenges.

If you are looking for a place to discuss Go and Advent of Code, then I suggest that you check out the [Discord Gophers](https://discord.gg/golang)' advent-of-code chat.

## Running solutions

I strongly encourage you to solve the challenges on your own, because I believe that's the best way to learn.

If you want to run the code anyway, you can do so like this:
```shell
go run ./cmd/<dayXX> <input_file>
```
